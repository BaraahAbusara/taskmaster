# taskmaster
This repository is going to hold my Android tasks provided by ASAC team 

## Version 1 : lab 26 - Beginning TaskMaster

For this lab I created a home page with a text , picture and two buttons :
- one leads me to add task page which enables me to add a task with title and body and gives me a response message when I click on add task button (this page doesn't save the task to the database yet).
- second button leads me to all tasks page that only has an image for now.

Pages other than the home page have a back home arrow in the header.
